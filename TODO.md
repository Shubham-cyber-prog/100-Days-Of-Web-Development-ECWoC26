# TODO: Standardize CSS File Naming Conventions

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze existing file structure and identify inconsistencies (some days use style.css, others styles.css, but in current repo only style.css exists)
- [x] Update CONTRIBUTING.md to include Project Structure section specifying file naming conventions (use style.css for daily projects)
- [x] Create PowerShell script (rename_css.ps1) to automate renaming styles.css to style.css and update HTML references
- [x] Run the script to standardize existing files (no changes needed as no styles.css files found)

## Summary
- Added detailed Project Structure guidelines to CONTRIBUTING.md to prevent future inconsistencies
- Created automation script for easy standardization of CSS file names
- Ensured all daily projects use "style.css" consistently
